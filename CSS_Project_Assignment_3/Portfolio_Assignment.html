                <h1>Hi there!</h1>
                <p>I am an uprising entrepreneur with 7+ years’ experience in the client relationship field and have assisted previous employers to build a stable relationship with their customers. Thus, these years of experience in presentation and customer management in the marketing and communications field has produced a desire to channel all prior and recent knowledge into a full-grown branding company. This branding will cover offline marketing but more importantly online marketing. The aim is to generate new customers for existing clients and to help manage their client customer relationship. Concurrently, I endeavour to provide the highest level of professionalism using good communication and customer-service skills.</p>
